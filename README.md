#  Smartwatch Health Dataset Analysis: Uncovering Jaw-Dropping Insights! 

> *If you want your ideas to resonate and lead the conversation, the right words—and data—make all the difference!*  
This repository houses a comprehensive **Python-based analysis** of the **Smartwatch Health Dataset**, conducted as part of my academic journey at **Lovely Professional University (LPU)**. By leveraging **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy**, this project cleans, explores, and visualizes health metrics like heart rate, step count, stress levels, and sleep duration to reveal actionable insights about activity levels and well-being.

## 📑 Project Overview

The **Smartwatch Health Dataset Analysis** aims to uncover meaningful patterns in health metrics collected from smartwatch users. The dataset includes variables such as `Heart Rate (BPM)`, `Step Count`, `Blood Oxygen Level (%)`, `Sleep Duration (hours)`, and `Stress Level`, categorized by `Activity Level` (Active, Highly Active, Sedentary). Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and visualizations, this project highlights how activity levels influence health outcomes.

Key objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships between health metrics.
- Perform statistical tests (ANOVA, T-tests) to validate findings.
- Derive insights to inform health and wellness strategies.
